# Final-Project
This game is a game that falls under the category “Animation application of game”. 
It will have a game screen where the game will be run, with a background with many 
obstacles and boundaries. The player can play via controlling an object within the 
game screen, The plyer must use their keyboard and/or mouse to avoid the obstacles 
and boundaries. If the player collides with any of the obstacles or boundaries, the 
player will lose health points. When the health point becomes zero, the game is over. 
The higher score the player can score while still alive determines how successful 
the player is.

#Getting Started

All you have to do to start this game is to run it. The rest of it will be handled 
via the program we coded.

#Prerequisites

No prerequisites required. Only to have to find the file in Github.

The program can be found by going through:
	Master
	> Final-Project
	> Demo1FinalProj
	> src
	
The inputs that the program will take in to move the character on the screen would be 
the "w", "s", "a", "d” keys and mouse movement.

#Running the tests

Some tests that could be used to make sure our test is running properly include:
	- Trying to move a character into a barrier and see if the code will properly note 
	  the collision.
	- Making sure the game actually ends when the player uses up all its health points

#Built With
