*Where to find the program*
The program will be located in the master branch on github; src > applications.


*How to compile & start the program*
Since we are using eclipse, our project will automatically compile when we run it. Thus we run it. Upon running 
it, a window will appear which contains an option, "PLAY". You click "PLAY" to play the game or close the window to 
terminate the program.

# The Ugly Duckling
This game is a game that falls under the category “Animation application game”. 
It will have a game screen where the game will be run, with obsacles falling 
from the sky. The player can play via controlling a duck within the game screen.
The player must use their keyboard (wsad keys) to avoid the obstacles and 
boundaries. If the player collides with any of the obstacles or boundaries, the 
player will lose health points. When the health point becomes zero, the game is over. 
The higher score the player can score while still alive determines how successful 
the player is.

#Getting Started

All you have to do to start this game is to run it. The rest of it will be handled 
via the program we coded. When the user runs the game, the menu button will pop up where the user can choose from the 3 options displayed: Play, options, and Credits. For demo 2, the only option that works is the Play button. The user must click the play button to start the game.

#Prerequisites

No prerequisites required. Only to have to find the file in Github.

The program can be found by going through:
	Master
	> Final-Project
	> src
	
The inputs that the program will take in to move the character on the screen would be 
the "w", "s", "a", "d” keys.

#Running the tests

Some tests that could be used to make sure our test is running properly include:
	- Trying to move a character into an obstacle and see if the code will properly note 
	  the collision.
	- Making sure the game actually ends when the player uses up all its health points.

#Built With
